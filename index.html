      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, I'm an Operations &amp; Project Manager with 4+ years of experience leading cross-functional initiatives and building the infrastructure behind high-performing teams.
      </p>
      <p>
        My background in both Computer Science and Business gives me a unique vantage point: I see the big picture, and I build the systems that bring it to life. From process design and team onboarding to Agile delivery and workflow automation, I bring order to complexity and momentum to strategy.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think of operations the way I think of playing bass: it's not always front and center, but it sets the rhythm, holds the structure, and gives everyone else the space to perform at their best.
      </p>
      <p>
        You won't always see it, but you'll feel it when it's working.
      </p>
